                Upon receiving the insights from the usability testing, it was observed that 
                the <span class="highlight">Error rate for selecting the lawyer's profile</span>  was high, possibly due to the 
                relatively small size of the button's touch area.  Additionally, it was noted that the 
                text appeared somewhat challenging to read, potentially due to the greyish text color. 
                Based on this feedback, an iterative process was carried out to address this issue.
